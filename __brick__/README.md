## Project Structure

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Clean Architecture principles.

```
lib/
├── core/           # Core utilities and base classes
├── domain/         # Business logic and entities
├── data/           # Data sources and repositories
└── presentation/   # UI and ViewModels
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Architecture

- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of UI (View), Business Logic (ViewModel), and Data (Model)
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency Rule - inner layers don't depend on outer layers
- **Result Pattern**: Type-safe error handling with `Result<Success, Failure>`
- **Command Pattern**: Async operations with loading/error states
- **Dependency Injection**: Using GetIt for service locator
